    1. Comments in JS are as:-
    - >  // THIS IS AN INLINE COMMENT
    - > /* THIS IS A MULTI-LINE COMMENT */

    2. There are 8 data types which are as:-
    - > undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object

    3. Assignment,intializing and assigning to other varaible are as shown:-
    - > var x;
        var a = 0;    // INTIALIZATION OF VARIABLE
        x = 7;        // ASSIGNMENT OF VARIABLE
        a = x;        // ASSIGNING ONE VAR TO OTHER

    4. String Declaration :-
    - > var x = "hello";

    5. Understanding unintialized values:-
    - > var a=5;
        var b=10;
        var c="I am a";
        // Only change code above this line

        a = a + 1;
        b = b + 5;
        c = c + " String!";
    
    6. Diff between var and let and use of const

    7. Use of operators and also the compound operators with augmented equations

    8. Escaping literal quotes in strings:-
    - > const sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";
        OUTCOME - Alan said, "Peter is learning JavaScript".
    
    9. Concatenating strings:-

    - >Code	Output
        \'	single quote
        \"	double quote
        \\	backslash
        \n	newline
        \t	tab
        \r	carriage return
        \b	word boundary
        \f  form feed

    - >const myName = "MEET";
